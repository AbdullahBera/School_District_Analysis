# Overview of the School District Analysis

## Purpose

In this analysis I supported Maria to analyze data from a variety of sources in a variety of formats of student scores from standardized tests in several schools. The data I analyzed is of 39,170 students from 15 schools where I used the Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda to run my code to analyze the data. The results of this analysis are intended to provide the School Board with insights regarding school performance, school budget, and school priorities. This analysis is done under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), respecting the privacy of the students in the data.  

## Objective 

I wanted to understand how changing the math and reading scores of students in Thomas High School will affect the district summary, school summary, Thomas High School's relative performance to the other school's. Furthermore, I also delivered results regarding how the change in the scores affected math and reading scores by grade, school spending, school size and school type. With these indicators I concluded the implications of replacing math and reading scores of students in Thomas High School with NaN's.
